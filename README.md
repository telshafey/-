# Alrehla Workspace

Alrehla is an Arabic educational marketplace and learning platform organized as a pnpm monorepo. The public marketplace now runs on Next.js App Router, while the admin panel remains a separate Vite app. Shared UI, API, auth, types, config, and utility code live in workspace packages.

## Apps

### `apps/marketplace`

The marketplace is a Next.js App Router application with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query, Supabase Auth, and shared workspace packages. It contains the public Arabic portal, blog/content pages, Enha Lak store, personalized story ordering flow, creative writing booking flow, cart and checkout, parent account area, and student/session pages.

The marketplace does not own admin routes. Staff/admin links should open the separate admin panel using `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PANEL_URL`.

### `apps/admin-panel`

The admin panel remains a separate React/Vite application on its own port. It contains admin, instructor, publisher, reporting, audit, settings, scheduling, financial, and product management pages. Frontend route guards use shared RBAC helpers from `packages/auth`; Supabase RLS and backend policies remain the source of truth for data authorization.

## Shared Packages

- `@alrehla/ui`: shared Button, Input, Modal, Table, Badge/Card-style primitives, Toast, loading/error components, and other presentational UI. No Supabase or business data access belongs here.
- `@alrehla/api`: Supabase client plus auth, user, order, booking, content, reporting, settings, storage, communication, and admin-facing services.
- `@alrehla/auth`: role definitions, permission matrix, and helpers such as `hasPermission`, `isAdminRole`, and `canAccessAdmin`.
- `@alrehla/types`: generated Supabase database types and shared domain models.
- `@alrehla/config`: shared constants, environment-backed config, and reusable seed/mock configuration.
- `@alrehla/utils`: formatting, validation, pricing, Arabic text, date, and helper functions.

## Environment Files

Each app owns its own environment file:

```text
apps/marketplace/.env.local
apps/admin-panel/.env
```

Marketplace Next.js variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_supabase_publishable_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_upload_preset
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PANEL_URL=http://localhost:3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_TRACKING_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

An example file is provided at `apps/marketplace/.env.local.example`.

Admin panel Vite variables:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_supabase_publishable_key
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
VITE_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_upload_preset
```

## Setup

Use pnpm for the workspace:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev                # run all dev apps through Turbo
pnpm dev:marketplace    # Next marketplace on port 3000
pnpm dev:admin          # Vite admin panel on port 3001
pnpm build              # build all apps/packages
pnpm lint               # lint all apps/packages
pnpm typecheck          # typecheck all apps/packages
```

You can also run scripts inside a specific app:

```bash
pnpm --filter @alrehla/marketplace dev
pnpm --filter @alrehla/admin-panel dev
```

## Marketplace Migration Notes

The previous Vite marketplace was preserved under `backups/marketplace-vite-2026-07-05`. The active marketplace no longer uses `index.html`, `vite.config.ts`, `src/index.tsx`, or React Router route declarations. Routes live under `apps/marketplace/src/app`, and migrated feature pages live under `apps/marketplace/src/features`.

Supabase and service access should stay in `packages/api`. Keep marketplace components focused on UI, hooks, and route composition.

## Database

Supabase SQL files live in `supabase/`:

- `00_setup.sql`: reusable schema, functions, policies, and storage setup
- `01_seed.sql`: reusable seed content and demo data

Do not enforce admin security only in React. Supabase RLS and database policies remain the source of truth for data access.
